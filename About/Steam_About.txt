  [h1]Gasch's Gear - Guns and Grenades[/h1]
  Author: Gasch
  Target Version: 0.19.2

  The aim of Gasch's Gear mods is to add small amounts of content and rebalancing to produce a smoother progression curve from tribal to spacer and make lesser-used portions of the game more meaningful.

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
  This is very likely to conflict with mods which alter vanilla firearms or firearm related research. It will not cause a crash if added to unmodded saves, but will cause many vanilla firearms and molotovs to disappear.
